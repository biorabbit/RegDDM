Description: 
    Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) has been widely used to model binary decision-making
    tasks, and many research studies the relationship between DDM parameters and
    other characteristics of the subject. This package uses "RStan" to perform 
    generalized liner regression analysis over DDM parameters via a single 
    Bayesian Hierarchical model. Compared to estimating DDM parameters followed 
    by a separate regression model, "RegDDM" reduces bias and improves statistical
    power.
